## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/krishnadevpmelevila/BioSecureCert/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/krishnadevpmelevila/BioSecureCert/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
